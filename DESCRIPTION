Description: windowscanr is a simple package with one main function: `winScan()`. This function 
             allows one to calculate any statistics across a sliding window. It works on data.frame objects, 
             and supports both "rolling" windows (simply based on the rows of the table) or "position" windows 
             (based on a variable of positions given by the user). It can apply any valid functions given by 
             the user and calculate windows based on grouping variables.
