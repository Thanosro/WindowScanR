# WindowScanr: sliding window analysis

![](./vignettes/window_example.png)

`windowscanr` is a simple package with one main function: `winScan()`. This function 
allows one to calculate any statistics across a sliding window. It works on data.frame objects, 
and supports both "rolling" windows (based on the rows of the table) or "position" windows 
(based on a variable of positions given by the user). 

It can apply any valid functions given by the user and define windows based on grouping variables. 

See the [package intro](./vignettes/windowscanr_intro.md) for more details.
